# Funnel Package â€” Cloudflare Pages Ready

Files:
- index.html          -> Landing page (policy-safe / educational)
- thank-you.html      -> Thank you page with Telegram link (replace placeholder)
- README.md           -> This file
- summary.pdf         -> optional sample PDF (small placeholder)

How to deploy (Cloudflare Pages):
1. Upload these files to a repository (GitHub) or directly to Cloudflare Pages.
2. Replace `https://t.me/YOUR_CHANNEL_LINK` in thank-you.html with your real Telegram invite link.
3. Add your Meta Pixel base code in index.html (commented placeholder) and a conversion event on thank-you.html if you want to track Leads.
4. Ensure pages are mobile-friendly and fast. Test on mobile before launching ads.
5. Use the ad creatives & copy provided in your ad account. Use CTA "Learn More" pointing to `index.html`.

Notes to avoid Meta rejection:
- Avoid words like "guaranteed", "profit", "signals" in ad creative.
- Use educational tone on ad and landing page.
- Put visible disclaimer on landing page.
- Do NOT include Telegram link in the ad creative or image itself.

Need modifications? Reply and I'll update files (e.g., add form handling, mailer integration, or pixel code).
